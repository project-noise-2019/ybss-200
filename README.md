# ybss-200
YBSS-200 is an environmental sound dataset created to aid research in the classification of background noise occurring in the context of human speech. 
Other environmental datasets (UrbanSound, DCASE, etc.) were created with an objective to have environmental sounds in the foreground and minimal interference with other sound sources as possible. 
The objective of the creation of YBSS-200 was to have a human voice and a unique background noise in each audio segment. YBSS-200 was manually collected using the youtube videos. 
It has 10 classes tap water, auto-rickshaw, cricket crowd, toy helicopter, formula one racing (on board), guitar, road traffic, sewing machine, grass cutting machine, and stapler gun.
